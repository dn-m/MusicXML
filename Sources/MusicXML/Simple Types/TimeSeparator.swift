/// The time-separator type indicates how to display the arrangement between the beats and beat-type
/// values in a time signature. The default value is none. The horizontal, diagonal, and vertical
/// values represent horizontal, diagonal lower-left to upper-right, and vertical lines
/// respectively. For these values, the beats and beat-type values are arranged on either side of
/// the separator line. The none value represents no separator with the beats and beat-type arranged
/// vertically. The adjacent value represents no separator with the beats and beat-type arranged
/// horizontally.
