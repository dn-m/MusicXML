/// The arrow-style type represents the style of an arrow, using Unicode arrow terminology. Filled
/// and hollow arrows indicate polygonal single arrows. Paired arrows are duplicate single arrows in
/// the same direction. Combined arrows apply to double direction arrows like left right, indicating
/// that an arrow in one direction should be combined with an arrow in the other direction.
