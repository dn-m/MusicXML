/// The start-stop-discontinue type is used to specify ending types. Typically, the start type is
/// associated with the left barline of the first measure in an ending. The stop and discontinue
/// types are associated with the right barline of the last measure in an ending. Stop is used when
/// the ending mark concludes with a downward jog, as is typical for first endings. Discontinue is
/// used when there is no downward jog, as is typical for second endings that do not conclude a
/// piece.
