/// The line-width-type defines what type of line is being defined in a line-width element. Values
/// include beam, bracket, dashes, enclosure, ending, extend, heavy barline, leger, light barline,
/// octave shift, pedal, slur middle, slur tip, staff, stem, tie middle, tie tip, tuplet bracket,
/// and wedge. This is left as a string so that other application-specific types can be defined, but
/// it is made a separate type so that it can be redefined more strictly.
