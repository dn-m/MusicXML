/// The color type indicates the color of an element. Color may be represented as hexadecimal RGB
/// triples, as in HTML, or as hexadecimal ARGB tuples, with the A indicating alpha of transparency.
/// An alpha value of 00 is totally transparent; FF is totally opaque. If RGB is used, the A value
/// is assumed to be FF.  For instance, the RGB value "#800080" represents purple. An ARGB value of
/// "#40800080" would be a transparent purple.  As in SVG 1.1, colors are defined in terms of the
/// sRGB color space (IEC 61966).
