/// The notehead type indicates shapes other than the open and closed ovals associated with note
/// durations. The values do, re, mi, fa, fa up, so, la, and ti correspond to Aikin's 7-shape
/// system. The fa up shape is typically used with upstems; the fa shape is typically used with
/// downstems or no stems.  The arrow shapes differ from triangle and inverted triangle by being
/// centered on the stem. Slashed and back slashed notes include both the normal notehead and a
/// slash. The triangle shape has the tip of the triangle pointing up; the inverted triangle shape
/// has the tip of the triangle pointing down. The left triangle shape is a right triangle with the
/// hypotenuse facing up and to the left.
