/// The MusicXML format supports eight levels of beaming, up to 1024th notes. Unlike the
/// `number-level` attribute, the beam-level attribute identifies concurrent beams in a beam group.
/// It does not distinguish overlapping beams such as grace notes within regular notes, or beams
/// used in different voices.
