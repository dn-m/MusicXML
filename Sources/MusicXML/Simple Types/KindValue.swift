/// A kind-value indicates the type of chord. Degree elements can then add, subtract, or alter from
/// these starting points. Values include:  Triads: major (major third, perfect fifth) minor (minor
/// third, perfect fifth) augmented (major third, augmented fifth) diminished (minor third,
/// diminished fifth) Sevenths: dominant (major triad, minor seventh) major-seventh (major triad,
/// major seventh) minor-seventh (minor triad, minor seventh) diminished-seventh (diminished triad,
/// diminished seventh) augmented-seventh (augmented triad, minor seventh) half-diminished
/// (diminished triad, minor seventh) major-minor (minor triad, major seventh) Sixths: major-sixth
/// (major triad, added sixth) minor-sixth (minor triad, added sixth) Ninths: dominant-ninth
/// (dominant-seventh, major ninth) major-ninth (major-seventh, major ninth) minor-ninth
/// (minor-seventh, major ninth) 11ths (usually as the basis for alteration): dominant-11th
/// (dominant-ninth, perfect 11th) major-11th (major-ninth, perfect 11th) minor-11th (minor-ninth,
/// perfect 11th) 13ths (usually as the basis for alteration): dominant-13th (dominant-11th, major
/// 13th) major-13th (major-11th, major 13th) minor-13th (minor-11th, major 13th) Suspended:
/// suspended-second (major second, perfect fifth) suspended-fourth (perfect fourth, perfect fifth)
/// Functional sixths: Neapolitan Italian French German Other: pedal (pedal-point bass) power
/// (perfect fifth) Tristan  The "other" kind is used when the harmony is entirely composed of add
/// elements. The "none" kind is used to explicitly encode absence of chords or functional harmony.
