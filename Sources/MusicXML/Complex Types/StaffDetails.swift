/// The staff-details element is used to indicate different types of staves. The print-object
/// attribute is used to indicate when a staff is not printed in a part, usually in large scores
/// where empty parts are omitted. It is yes by default. If print-spacing is yes while print-object
/// is no, the score is printed in cutaway format where vertical space is left for the empty part.

    /// The staff-type value can be ossia, cue, editorial, regular, or alternate. An alternate staff
    /// indicates one that shares the same musical data as the prior staff, but displayed
    /// differently (e.g., treble and bass clef, standard notation and tab).
    public let staffType: StaffType?

    /// The staff-lines element specifies the number of lines for a non 5-line staff.
    public let staffLines: Int?

    /// The staff-tuning type specifies the open, non-capo tuning of the lines on a tablature staff.
    public let staffTuning: [StaffTuning]

    /// The capo element indicates at which fret a capo should be placed on a fretted instrument.
    /// This changes the open tuning of the strings specified by staff-tuning by the specified
    /// number of half-steps.
    public let capo: Int?

    /// The staff-size element indicates how large a staff space is on this staff, expressed as a
    /// percentage of the work's default scaling. Values less than 100 make the staff space smaller
    /// while values over 100 make the staff space larger. A staff-type of cue, ossia, or editorial
    /// implies a staff-size of less than 100, but the exact value is implementation-dependent
    /// unless specified here. Staff size affects staff height only, not the relationship of the
    /// staff to the left and right margins.
