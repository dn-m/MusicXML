//  The attributes DTD module contains the attributes element
//  and its children, such as key and time signatures.

/// The attributes element contains musical information that typically changes on measure
/// boundaries. This includes key and time signatures, clefs, transpositions, and staving. When
/// attributes are changed mid-measure, it affects the music in score order, not in MusicXML
/// document order.
