/// The ending type represents multiple (e.g. first and second) endings. Typically, the start type
/// is associated with the left barline of the first measure in an ending. The stop and discontinue
/// types are associated with the right barline of the last measure in an ending. Stop is used when
/// the ending mark concludes with a downward jog, as is typical for first endings. Discontinue is
/// used when there is no downward jog, as is typical for second endings that do not conclude a
/// piece. The text-x and text-y attributes are offsets that specify where the baseline of the start
/// of the ending text appears, relative to the start of the ending line. The ending element text is
/// used when the text displayed in the ending is different than what appears in the number
/// attribute. The print-object element is used to indicate when an ending is present but not
/// printed, as is often the case for many parts in a full score.
