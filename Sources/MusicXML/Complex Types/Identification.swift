    /// be multiple creators within an identification. Standard type values are composer, lyricist,
    /// and arranger. Other type values may be used for different types of creative roles. The type
    /// attribute should usually be used even if there is just a single creator element. The
    /// MusicXML format does not use the creator / contributor distinction from Dublin Core.

    /// intellectual property notices. Words, music, and derivatives can have different types, so
    /// multiple rights tags with different type attributes are supported. Standard type values are
    /// music, words, and arrangement, but other types may be used. The type attribute is only
    /// needed when there are multiple rights elements.

    /// what software, and in what aspects. Standard type values for the encoder element are music,

    /// there are multiple encoder elements.
