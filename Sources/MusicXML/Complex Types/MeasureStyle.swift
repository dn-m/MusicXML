/// A measure-style indicates a special way to print partial to multiple measures within a part.
/// This includes multiple rests over several measures, repeats of beats, single, or multiple
/// measures, and use of slash notation. The multiple-rest and measure-repeat symbols indicate the
/// number of measures covered in the element content. The beat-repeat and slash elements can cover
/// partial measures. All but the multiple-rest element use a type attribute to indicate starting
/// and stopping the use of the style.
