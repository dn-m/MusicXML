/// The bend type is used in guitar and tablature. The bend-alter element indicates the number of
/// steps in the bend, similar to the alter element. As with the alter element, numbers like 0.5 can
/// be used to indicate microtones. Negative numbers indicate pre-bends or releases; the pre-bend
/// and release elements are used to distinguish what is intended. A with-bar element indicates that
/// the bend is to be done at the bridge with a whammy or vibrato bar. The content of the element
/// indicates how this should be notated.
