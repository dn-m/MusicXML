/// Time modification indicates tuplets, double-note tremolos, and other durational changes. A
/// time-modification element shows how the cumulative, sounding effect of tuplets and double-note
/// tremolos compare to the written note type represented by the type and dot elements. Nested
/// tuplets and other notations that use more detailed information need both the time-modification
/// and tuplet elements to be represented accurately.

    /// the number in the normal-notes element.
