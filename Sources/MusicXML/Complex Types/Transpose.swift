    /// The diatonic element specifies the number of pitch steps needed to go from written to
    /// sounding pitch. This allows for correct spelling of enharmonic transpositions.

    /// The chromatic element represents the number of semitones needed to get from written to
    /// sounding pitch. This value does not include octave-change values; the values for both
    /// elements need to be added to the written pitch to get the correct sounding pitch.
    public let chromatic: Int

    /// The octave-change element indicates how many octaves to add to get from written pitch to
    /// sounding pitch.

    /// from what is currently written (as is the case for mixed cello / bass parts in orchestral
    /// literature).
