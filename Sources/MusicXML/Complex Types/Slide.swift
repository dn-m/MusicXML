/// Glissando and slide types both indicate rapidly moving from one pitch to the other so that
/// individual notes are not discerned. The distinction is similar to that between NIFF's glissando
/// and portamento elements. A slide is continuous between two notes and defaults to a solid line.
/// The optional text for a is printed alongside the line.
