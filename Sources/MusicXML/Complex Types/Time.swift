/// Time signatures are represented by the beats element for the numerator and the beat-type element
/// for the denominator. Multiple pairs of beat and beat-type elements are used for composite time
/// signatures with multiple denominators, such as 2/4 + 3/8. A composite such as 3+2/8 requires
/// only one beat/beat-type pair. The print-object attribute allows a time signature to be specified
/// but not printed, as is the case for excerpts from the middle of a score. The value is "yes" if
/// not present.

    /// beat-type values in a time signature. The default value is none. The horizontal, diagonal,
    /// and vertical values represent horizontal, diagonal lower-left to upper-right, and vertical
    /// lines respectively. For these values, the beats and beat-type values are arranged on either
    /// side of the separator line. The none value represents  no separator with the beats and
    /// beat-type arranged vertically. The adjacent value represents no separator with the beats and
    /// beat-type arranged horizontally.
