/// The part-list identifies the different musical parts in this movement. Each part has an ID that
/// is used later within the musical data. Since parts may be encoded separately and combined later,
/// identification elements are present at both the score and score-part levels. There must be at
/// least one score-part, combined as desired with part-group elements that indicate braces and
/// brackets. Parts are ordered from top to bottom in a score based on the order in which they
/// appear in the part-list.
