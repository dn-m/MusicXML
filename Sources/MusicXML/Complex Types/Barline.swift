/// If a barline is other than a normal single barline, it should be represented by a barline type
/// that describes it. This includes information about repeats and multiple endings, as well as line
/// style. Barline data is on the same level as the other musical data in a score - a child of a
/// measure in a partwise score, or a part in a timewise score. This allows for barlines within
/// measures, as in dotted barlines that subdivide measures in complex meters. The two fermata
/// elements allow for fermatas on both sides of the barline (the lower one inverted). If no
/// location is specified, the right barline is the default.

    // MARK: Attributes

    /// Barlines have a location attribute to make it easier to process barlines independently of
    /// the other musical data in a score. It is often easier to set up measures separately from
    /// entering notes. The location attribute must match where the barline element occurs within
    /// the rest of the musical data in the score. If location is left, it should be the first
    /// element in the measure, aside from the print, bookmark, and link elements. If location is
    /// right, it should be the last element, again with the possible exception of the print,
    /// bookmark, and link elements.
    public var location: RightLeftMiddle?

    /// The segno attribute works the same way as the one in the sound element. It is used for
    /// playback when barline elements contain a segno element.
    public var segno: String?

    /// The coda attribute works the same way as the one in the sound element. It is used for
    /// playback when a barline element contains a coda child element.
    public var coda: String?

    /// The divisions attribute works the same way as the one in the sound element. It is used for
    /// playback when a barline element contains a divisions element.
    public var divisions: Int?

    // MARK: Elements

    /// The bar-style type represents barline style information. Choices are regular, dotted,
    /// dashed, heavy, light-light, light-heavy, heavy-light, heavy-heavy, tick (a short stroke
    /// through the top line), short (a partial barline between the 2nd and 4th lines), and none.
