// > If a barline is other than a normal single barline, it
// > should be represented by a barline element that describes
// > it. This includes information about repeats and multiple
// > endings, as well as line style. Barline data is on the same
// > level as the other musical data in a score - a child of a
// > measure in a partwise score, or a part in a timewise score.
// > This allows for barlines within measures, as in dotted
// > barlines that subdivide measures in complex meters. The two
// > fermata elements allow for fermatas on both sides of the
// > barline (the lower one inverted).
//
// > Barlines have a location attribute to make it easier to
// > process barlines independently of the other musical data
// > in a score. It is often easier to set up measures
// > separately from entering notes. The location attribute
// > must match where the barline element occurs within the
// > rest of the musical data in the score. If location is left,
// > it should be the first element in the measure, aside from
// > the print, bookmark, and link elements. If location is
// > right, it should be the last element, again with the
// > possible exception of the print, bookmark, and link
// > elements. If no location is specified, the right barline
// > is the default. The segno, coda, and divisions attributes
// > work the same way as in the sound element defined in the
// > direction.mod file. They are used for playback when barline
// > elements contain segno or coda child elements.

// > Endings refers to multiple (e.g. first and second) endings.
// > Typically, the start type is associated with the left
// > barline of the first measure in an ending. The stop and
// > discontinue types are associated with the right barline of
// > the last measure in an ending. Stop is used when the ending
// > mark concludes with a downward jog, as is typical for first
// > endings. Discontinue is used when there is no downward jog,
// > as is typical for second endings that do not conclude a
// > piece. The length of the jog can be specified using the
// > end-length attribute. The text-x and text-y attributes
// > are offsets that specify where the baseline of the start
// > of the ending text appears, relative to the start of the
// > ending line.
//
// > The number attribute reflects the numeric values of what
// > is under the ending line. Single endings such as "1" or
// > comma-separated multiple endings such as "1, 2" may be
// > used. The ending element text is used when the text
// > displayed in the ending is different than what appears in
// > the number attribute. The print-object element is used to
// > indicate when an ending is present but not printed, as is
// > often the case for many parts in a full score.
